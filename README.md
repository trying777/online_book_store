Developed a full-stack web application for buying and selling books online.
*Backend*: Built using Spring Boot, providing RESTful APIs for user management, book catalog, orders, cart, and wishlist functionalities.
Frontend: Developed using Angular to create a responsive, user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and purchasing books.
Implemented secure user registration, login, and order management features.
Integrated MySQL database for persistent storage of users, books, and orders.
Followed best practices in API development, data validation, and error handling.

There is a growing need for a simple and efficient online platform to buy and manage books.
Traditional book shopping lacks flexibility and is time-consuming.
This project aims to create an Online Book Store where:
Users can browse, search, and buy books easily
They can manage carts, wishlist, and orders
Admins can add, update, or remove books and manage users

The system will be built using:
1. Spring Boot for the backend
2. Angular for the frontend
3. 3. MySQL for the database


*Backend:*

Spring Boot: Framework for building RESTful APIs, handling business logic, and data access with JPA (Java Persistence API).

MySQL: Relational database for storing user data, book inventory, orders, and wishlist items.

Spring Security: Used for user authentication and authorization (login, registration).

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database interactions using Java Persistence API.

*Frontend:*

Angular: Framework for building a dynamic and responsive user interface, including search, cart, and order management features.

HTML/CSS: For designing user interfaces with a clean and modern look.

JavaScript/TypeScript: For handling dynamic functionalities and user interactions.

*Additional Tools & Libraries:*

Spring Boot DevTools: Enables faster development with features like automatic restarts.

Postman: Used for testing the REST APIs during development.

Maven: For project management and building the backend application.
